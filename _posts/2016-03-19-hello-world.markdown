Hello guys...

This is my first post in this blog, so I just wanna say [Hello world] to all of you. It has been a few years since my last random blog. I decided to write this blog as per request from friends of mine. 'Cause all of them is Indonesian, so the language that will be used in this blog are the mix and match between English and Bahasa. Actually Bahasa will more dominant. 'Cause I am proud to be an Indonesian. Haehae...

The focus of this blog is technical topics relevant to all iOS things. You know lah ya, iOS has two programming languages. Objective-C and Swift. Actually I want to share what I know about them. But after some considerations, I will put Swift only. Sorry for the long wait guys...üòÅ

Last but not least,

<p class="center">Happy coding. Cheers! ü§ì<br/>. . .</p>
