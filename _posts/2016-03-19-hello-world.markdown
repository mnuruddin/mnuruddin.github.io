Hello guys...

This is my first post in this blog, so I just wanna say [Hello world] to all of you. It has been a few years since my last random blog. I decided to write this blog as per request from friends of mine. 'Cause all of them is Indonesian, so the language that will be used in this blog are the mix and match between English and Bahasa. Actually Bahasa will more dominant. 'Cause I am proud to be an Indonesian. Haehae...üòÑ

The focus of this blog is technical topics relevant to all iOS things. You know lah ya, iOS has two programming languages. Objective-C and Swift. Actually I want to share what I know about them. But after some considerations, I will put Swift only. Why Swift?

<ul>
	<li>Easy to learn. Easy to read.</li>
	<li>Modern language, similiar to Python and Ruby.</li>
	<li>Designed to remove complexity.</li>
	<li>Open source. So it will be the coding language for the people by the people.</li>
</ul>

Last but not least, I hope we can reach our dreams together through knowledge sharing. 

Sorry for the long wait guys...üòÅ
